Network Fitness Probe

In an attempt to help the provider guys diagnose the occasional losses
of connectivity and tune up the connection, I've scribbled this little
[Ruby][ruby] probe, which I run on my OSX stack to automate this process
for me. It takes a list of domains, runs network diagnostics command(s)
for each of them and dumps outputs into a timestamped subfolder
of [`results/`][results], which is then ZIPped up for better transport.

    $ ruby probe.rb

The results subfolder can also optionally be tagged with an argument.
