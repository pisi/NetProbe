`results/`
----------

Results of diagnostic commands are dumped into this folder's subfolder.
The subfolder is timestamped and, if tag was provided, also tagged.
Inside the subfolder, each command's result produces one plain text file
named after the host probed and the command.

**Note:** Actual results are excluded from this repository.
